# Python Loan Ladder 

Loans are a crooked necessity and crippling debt has become a way of life for many people. Unfortunately we as consumers are often uninformed or unaware that there are ways to minimize the amount of money that we pay back to our lenders. This project aims to alleviate the stressors of dealing with loans and possibly help to create better plans for money management.

# Purpose

This app is primarily intented to help users understand basic financing and loan payments. A secondary purpose is to learn Python at an intermediate level and see what I can do with it.

# Future

The future of this app is a mix between desktop app and web app. I'm not sure yet if I want to proceed with either, so I'm doing a little of both while I try to decide. I would like to replicate a CI loop and learn the process inside and out, and I understand that the process is much easier when dealing with web apps vs. desktop.

# Contributing

Issues are created for each task which will add business value to the application, and tasks are tracked in Github projects. Preferably there will be a branch structure which keeps the master or release branch free from clutter.
