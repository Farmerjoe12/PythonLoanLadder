# Python Loan Ladder 

Loans are a crooked necessity and crippling debt has become a way of life for many people. Unfortunately we as consumers are often uninformed or unaware that there are ways to minimize the amount of money that we pay back to our lenders. This project aims to alleviate the stressors of dealing with loans and possibly help to create better plans for money management.
